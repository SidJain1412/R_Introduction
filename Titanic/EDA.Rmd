## Introduction
We are analysing the various factors determining survival rates on the Titanic disaster. To do this, we will use various different features available about the passengers and visualize them.

### Importing the data
```{r}
test = read.csv('test.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
train = read.csv('train.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(test)
```
### Visualizing missing data in the dataset
```{r}
library("naniar")
vis_miss(train)
```
Age has many missing values.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=train[1:dim(train)[1],],aes(x=Sex,fill=Survived))+geom_bar()+ theme_classic()
```
