## Seatbelts Dataset
```{r}

data("Seatbelts")
Seatbelts <- data.frame(Year=floor(time(Seatbelts)),Month = factor(cycle(Seatbelts)), Seatbelts)
```
#### 10 Variables:
```{r}
str(Seatbelts)
```
#### Splitting data into before and after introduction of seatbelt legislation: 
#### We do so based on the 'law' variable (0 for before, 1 for after)
```{r}
BeforeLaw <- Seatbelts[Seatbelts$law ==0,]
AfterLaw <- Seatbelts[Seatbelts$law ==1,]

summary(BeforeLaw)

summary(AfterLaw)

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(Seatbelts, aes(x=factor(law), y=DriversKilled)) + geom_boxplot(fill="mediumpurple3") + theme_grey() +ylab("Monthly Driver Mortality") + xlab("Before and After seatbelt law")
```
